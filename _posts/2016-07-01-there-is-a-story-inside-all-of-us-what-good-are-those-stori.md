There is a story inside all of us.  
What good are those stories if they are never heard?

In its most basic form -- storytelling is an act of selflessness.  
By sharing your story -- you are sharing a connection with humanity.

5 AM exists for this very reason. To tell the stories that were meant to be told.

From writing and directing to cinematography and post-production -- we are skilled in every step.  
We are storytellers -- and we desire to exhibit truth and honesty throughout everything we do.

Given the opportunity -- we would love to tell your story.
